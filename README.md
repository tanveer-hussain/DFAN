# DFAN (TIP2022)
## Optimized Dual Fire Attention Network and Medium-Scale Fire Classification Benchmark

This paper has been accepted to IEEE Transactions on Image Processing

To download the framework: [DFAN.pdf]()

### 1. Paper Links
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9898909

IEEE-TIP: 
## 2. Setup
You need to install Tensorflow (preferred 2.9.0) and some basic libraries including PIL, cv2, numpy, etc.
For installation used 
pip install -r requirements.txt

## 3. How to Train?
In the repository, the DFAN.ipynb file is used to train the orignal DFAN model, where the Attention_mechanism_with_InceptionV3_github_compress_de is used for compress version. 

### 3.1. Datasets
The datasets can be downloaded from the following links. We follow the training and testing data similar to the previous methods.
